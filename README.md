**Description:**

This Python script demonstrates an interactive chat interface with OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, creating an AI assistant capable of engaging in conversation with users. The script utilizes the OpenAI API to interact with the GPT model, allowing users to input messages which the AI assistant responds to in real-time.

**Features:**

- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Users can input messages into the console, initiating a conversation with the AI assistant.
- **Real-time Responses:** The AI assistant generates responses based on the user's input using OpenAI's GPT model, providing immediate feedback.
- **Role-based Messaging:** Messages are categorized by role (user, assistant, system) for clarity and context within the conversation.
- **Dynamic Chat History:** The script maintains a chat history, allowing users to review previous messages and responses during the conversation.

**Usage:**

1. Ensure you have an OpenAI API key and replace `{YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}` with your actual API key.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Enter messages into the console to engage in a conversation with the AI assistant.

**Dependencies:**

- `openai`: Python package for interfacing with the OpenAI API.
- `Python 3.x`: Python interpreter for running the script.

**Note:** This script serves as a basic example of how to interact with OpenAI's GPT model for conversational AI purposes. It can be further extended and customized to suit specific use cases and applications.
